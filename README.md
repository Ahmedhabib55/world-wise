### Description:

World-Wise is an interactive travel journal application designed to empower users to capture and relive their global adventures. Built with React and leveraging CSS Modules for modular styling, it offers a user-friendly experience for documenting trips across the world.

### Key Features:

- **Interactive Map**: A central map component serves as the foundation for trip visualization. Users can seamlessly add points of interest (POIs) to specific locations on the map.
- **Rich Note-Taking**: Each POI allows users to create detailed notes about their experiences, including text, images, and potentially even short videos. This fosters personalized
  and immersive travel diary.
- **Location Awareness**: The application harnesses device location capabilities (with user permission) to potentially suggest relevant POIs or tailor recommendations based on the
  user's current surroundings.
- **State Management**: React Context provides a structured approach to manage application state, ensuring data consistency and seamless updates across components.
- **React Hooks**: World-Wise employs modern React hooks to manage state, fetch data, and handle side effects effectively, leading to clean and maintainable code.
- **Navigation**: React Router enables intuitive navigation between different views within the application, such as the map, individual trip details, and potentially even settings or
  profile management.
